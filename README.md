This is my repository for Question 1 of the Developer Take Home Test from Signature Business solutions.

This will be a .NET MVC webApp created in Visual Studio 

I will create a database based on the given structure.

The webApp will have a Login Page where the user lands on. 
The Login page will use a username and password for authentication, and will return an error if the login credentials are invalid.

The user will be redirected to the Info Page if the login credentials are valid.

The Info page will display and allow for the editing of user infromation. 
The user information may not be updated using post-back.

After the webApp has been created, it will easily deployable.
